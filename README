Persistent Vectors for C
========================

I Read a series of excellent blog posts about how clojure implements its
Persistent Vectors. I figured I would try and recreate them in C as a fun
challenge. The result is contained in this repository. The blog posts which
were an invaluable resource during thsi project can be found at the following
links.

Building
========
I haven't bothered to make this into a proper library yet, for now you can build
the test with

```
clang -fPIC -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 pvec.c -o pvec
```
